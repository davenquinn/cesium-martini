This package contains a Cesium
[TerrainProvider](https://cesium.com/docs/cesiumjs-ref-doc/TerrainProvider.html)
that uses right-triangular irregular networks (RTIN) pioneered by
[Mapbox's Martini](https://observablehq.com/@mourner/martin-real-time-rtin-terrain-mesh)
to transform
[Terrain-RGB elevation tiles](https://blog.mapbox.com/global-elevation-data-6689f1d0ba65)
into [quantized mesh terrain](https://github.com/CesiumGS/quantized-mesh), for
rendering in the [CesiumJS digital globe](https://cesium.com). The module
provides a general technique applicable to all raster imagery (although the
Terrain-RGB format is near-ideal for streaming elevation data). Fixes for
performance and better control of rendering quality are in progress.

This module was created to support our geologic map visualization work at
[Macrostrat](https://macrostrat.org) and as a building block for future rich
geoscience visualizations.

## Installation

This package is listed on NPM as `@macrostrat/cesium-martini`. It can be
installed using the command

```
npm install --save @macrostrat/cesium-martini
```

## Development

As of version `1.3.x`, `cesium-martini` development is tested with the Yarn
package manager. Your mileage with `npm` may vary.

### Quick start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Build the package with `yarn run build`

After cloning this repository, you can build the module (using Rollup) with
`yarn run build`, or build and watch for changes with `yarn run watch`.

### Example applications

Several example applications are available in the [`examples/`](examples/)
directory and runnable from the root project. The main example is built with
Vite and others are built with Webpack v5. As well as showing how to use this
module, these examples contain configuration for bundling Cesium in each
packaging system.

To run an example application, add `MAPBOX_API_TOKEN=<your-mapbox-token>` to a
`.env` file. in the root of this repository, and then start the appropriate
example:

- `yarn run example` (Vite)
- `yarn run example:mapzen` (Vite + Mapzen)
- `yarn run example:webpack` (Webpack)
- `yarn run example:webpack-mapzen` (Webpack + Mapzen)
- `yarn run example:webpack-react` (Webpack + React)

Contributions in the form of bug reports and pull requests are welcome. These
can be to add functionality (e.g. optional normal-map generation) or for
performance. See list of [known limitations](#current-known-limitations) below.

## Motivation

The Cesium digital globe is a powerful platform for visualization of geospatial
data in 3D. Cesium maintains a global elevation dataset as a prebuilt terrain
mesh, which caches the computationally-intensive step of meshing height-field
data into a triangle irregular network (TIN). Unfortunately, this
[quantized mesh](https://github.com/CesiumGS/quantized-mesh) format is
relatively new, narrowly supported and tailored to Cesium itself. Supporting a
TIN format for elevation datasets requires maintenance of significant
single-purpose processing pipelines and storage resources.

### Fast raster meshing

Mapbox maintains a multiscale global elevation dataset in their clever
[terrain-RGB](https://blog.mapbox.com/global-elevation-data-6689f1d0ba65)
format, which bridges web standard file formats (PNG images) with traditional
raster GIS formats for representing terrain. Rasters are the standard
representation of elevation data across the geosciences, and many pipelines are
available to create and modify raster images. Basically any elevation dataset
can be easily rescaled to the Terrain-RGB format, but the jump from there to a
"Quantized mesh" is more complicated.

More recently, [Vladimir Agafonkin](https://agafonkin.com/) at Mapbox
demonstrated an
[elegant algorithmic approach](https://observablehq.com/@mourner/martin-real-time-rtin-terrain-mesh)
that sidesteps this issue. His [MARTINI](https://github.com/mapbox/martini)
project constructs meshes based on right-triangulated irregular networks (RTIN,
_Evans et al., 1998_) and is far quicker than the traditional TIN generation
techniques.

A speedy meshing algorithm allows this data-preparation step to be handled in
the browser after elevation tiles are loaded. Integrating this toolchain into
the Cesium digital globe enables the usage of Mapbox global data and other
raster terrain layers (e.g. planetary and bathymetric data!), without adding
overhead of TIN processing and storage.

### Progressive mesh enhancement (added in version `1.5.0`)

Cesium `TerrainProvider`s are generally designed to represent static terrain
meshes. The RTIN algorithm used here can dynamically build meshes at a variety
of error levels, and the input height fields can represent extremely detailed
meshes at a given zoom level.

By default, meshes are generated at levels of detail that undersample the
available structure in a terrain tile, calibrated to what Cesium needs to render
visually pleasing output at a given zoom level. To more fully exploit the
available data, we can generate meshes at progressively higher resolution from
the same input data. This allows some zoom levels to be skipped, greatly
increasing efficiency.

This "overzooming" can be enabled using the `skipZoomLevels` configuration. For
instance, the below function will refuse to load tiles except in

```js
function skipZoomLevels(z) {
  return z % 3 != 0;
}
```

The configuration also takes a single number and array.

### Outstanding bugs and issues

- [x] High-resolution `@2x` tiles are notionally supported but not well-tested.
- [ ] There is no formal testing framework to catch regressions.
- [x] TypeScript types are discarded on compilation rather than checked
      properly.
